## 🎖 About Me

🔹 **Former Manpower Officer, Captain, United States Marine Corps**  
As a seasoned Manpower Officer with the United States Marine Corps, I've spent the greater half of a decade honing my leadership skills, strategic thinking, and commitment to excellence. The discipline, adaptability, and resilience I've gained have been invaluable.

🔹 **Scientific Acumen**  
Before my military tenure, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. I contributed to groundbreaking research in the biology of aging, honing my scientific methodology and developing a deep understanding of data analysis and experimental design. This background really helps with prompt engineering.

🔹 **CEO of LangLabs**  
Today, I'm channeling these skills into my latest venture: LangLabs, the premiere AI Automation Development firm. We specialize in crafting brilliant, expert AI solutions tailored to your business needs. Our AI chatbots are trained on your unique business data, enhancing customer communication and boosting productivity.

## 🤖 Special Interests

🔸 **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**  
I'm particularly captivated by the potential of AGI. The idea of creating intelligent agents that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do is not just a dream, but a future we're actively working towards.

🔸 **Autonomous Agent Architectures**  
The architecture behind autonomous agents fascinates me. It's the backbone that allows AI to interact with its environment to achieve specific goals, and it's a field ripe for innovation.
